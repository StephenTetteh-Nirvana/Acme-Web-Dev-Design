               Our learn-by-doing approach incorporates projects based on real-world scenarios. They arent just multiple choice questions graded by botsâ€”they are open-ended and require critical thinking. Just like the workplace.
               Unlike typical professors, our instructors come from Fortune 500 and Global 2000 companies and have demonstrated leadership and expertise in their professions.
